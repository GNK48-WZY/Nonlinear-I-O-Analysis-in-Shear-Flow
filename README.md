### RHS function:  

Purpose:

The function RHS is designed to compute the right-hand side (RHS) of the governing equations for different fluid dynamics models. These models include various shear flow models, Trefethen models, and others based on references such as the work of Lebovitz & Mariotti (2013) and Trefethen et al. (1993).
